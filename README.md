# CI-CD-Demo - Simple Todo App using Django

A simple Django PostgreSQL todo_tasks application project hosted using K8s minikube cluster

[+] Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/py-sponser/CI-CD-Demo.git
- cd CI-CD-Demo/
- ./create_components.sh will set up everything for you ;)

There are also a script for deleting K8s components:
- ./delete_components.sh
- Note: you may find an error removing a docker image at the end, you need to remove it manually.

Later on, Jenkins will be added to the process to complete CI/CD
